# Team D
UMass Meal Builder App

## Description

A nutrition-based web app designed to provide University of Massachusetts Amherst students with personalized dietary options and nutritional information for meals served in the dining commons. The app allows users to select food based on their dietary preferences and restrictions and provides access to comprehensive nutritional information, including calorie counts, macronutrient breakdowns, and allergen warnings. Users can also set alerts for their favorite meals and track their nutrition to make informed decisions about their dietary choices. With this app, UMass students can easily navigate the dining commons and create a more inclusive dining experience for all.
